# Logic Building Programs – Archive

This repository contains 500+ logic-building programs solved earlier during my
foundational programming phase (C, C++, Java).

⚠️ Note:
- Programs were written during early learning stages
- File names follow a simple sequence (program1.c, program2.c, ...)
- Focus was on logic building, not naming or documentation

## Languages
- C
- C++
- Java

## Topics Covered
- Conditions & loops
- Functions
- Arrays & strings
- Patterns
- Recursion
- Bitwise operations
- Searching & sorting
- Basic data structures

## Purpose of This Repo
- Demonstrate long-term consistency in problem-solving
- Show strong programming fundamentals across multiple languages
- Preserve early learning work as reference
